      <p class="message">
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML provides a
        means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
        for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other
        items. <br />
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags
        such as <span><</span> <span>img</span> <span>/></span> directly
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span><</span
        ><span>p</span><span>/></span> surround and provide information about
        document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do
        not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the
        page.

      <h2 class="title">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
      <p class="message">
        CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
        document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is
        designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including
        layout, colors, and fonts.<br />This separation can improve content
        accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
        of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
        formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which
        reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
        the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
        pages that share the file and its formatting.

      <h2 class="title">JavaScript (JS)</h2>
      <p class="message">
        JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
        implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
        more than just sit there and display static information for you to look
        at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D
        graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript
        is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of
        standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered
        in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
